12. Static data members in C++
13. Some interesting facts about static member functions
	1. static member functions do not have this pointer.
	2. A static member function cannot be virtual
	3. Member function declarations with the same name 
	   and the name parameter-type-list cannot be overloaded 
           if any of them is a static member function declaration
	4. A static member function can not be declared const, volatile, or const volatile.

14. Friend class and function
15. Local Class
16. Nested Classes
17. Simulating final class

Function Overloading:
=====================
1. Function Overloading
2. Functions that canâ€™t be overloaded
3. Function overloading and const keyword
4. Function overloading and return type
5. Does overloading work with Inheritance?
6. Can main() be overloaded
7. Function Overloading and float


Facts:
======
1) A local class type name can only be used in the enclosing function. For example, in the following program, declarations of t and tp are valid in fun(), but invalid in main().

2) All the methods of Local classes must be defined inside the class only. For example, program 1 works fine and program 2 fails in compilation.

3) A Local class cannot contain static data members. It may contain static functions though. For example, program 1 fails in compilation, but program 2 works fine.

4) Member methods of local class can only access static and enum variables of the enclosing function. Non-static variables of the enclosing function are not accessible inside local classes. For example, the program 1 compiles and runs fine. But, program 2 fails in compilation.

5) Local classes can access global types, variables and functions. Also, local classes can access other local classes of same function.. For example, following program works fine.
