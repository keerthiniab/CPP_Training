Virtual
=======
1. Virtual Functions and Runtime Polymorphism
	* What is the use?
	* Static Linkage & Dyanamic Linkage
	* vtable , vptr
2. Default arguments and virtual function
3. Virtual functions in derived classes
4. Can static functions be virtual?
5. Virtual Destructor
6. Virtual Constructor
7. Virtual Copy Constructor
8. RTTI (Run-time type information)
9. Can virtual functions be private?
10. Inline virtual function
11. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
	* A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
	* We can have pointers and references of abstract class type.
	* If we do not override the pure virtual function in derived class, then derived class also becomes abstract class
	* An abstract class can have constructors
	* Interface vs Abstract Classes:
12. Pure virtual destructor
